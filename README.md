# Board-Game-Master  (ARCHIVED)
Program made using Unity and Github for Unity, for making customized board games

Note: as of May 7th 2024, I (TA) am archiving this repository as we have not worked on it in a long time. If I ever plan on working on it again, I may switch to a different game engine, and thus may do a complete rewrite.
